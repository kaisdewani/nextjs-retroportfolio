I had originally created my portfolio project way back around 2018 - 2019 when I was first learning about react. Years later, I ended up using the same domain name to complete the cloud resume challenge. In that time, my resume has had multiple updates, and I wanted a better way to present myself as in the cloud resume challenge, I had just simply pasted my resume in basic HTML which looks ugly and basic.

I recently came across a git project called React95 ([https://github.com/React95/React95](https://github.com/React95/React95)) and I absolutely love the aesthetic. I have always had a soft spot for retro/outrun vibes and wanted to show that for my personal website.

The great thing about react95 is that it still has react compatible components which was great since I had originally started with react back in the day. For this project, I went with NextJS just in case I want to add pages. The NextJS page router will make it simpler hopefully in the future if I ever end up building out with more pages which I don't think will happen since react95 seems to be more of a “modal” type of layout.

This was very much inspired by the following repos as I tried to figure out how to ‘connect the dots’ for the components to work on my page-

I forked the same NextJS React95 repo as [casamento-nextjs](https://github.com/henriquespecian/casamento-nextjs)
