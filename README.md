# Retro-themed Portfolio Project using React95 and Next.js

## Introduction
I originally created my portfolio project back in 2018-2019 when I was first learning about React. However, over the years, my resume has undergone multiple updates, and I felt the need for a better presentation. Recently, I stumbled upon React95, a Git project that resonated with my love for retro/outrun vibes. I decided to revamp my portfolio using React95's aesthetic.

## Project Details
- **Technology Stack**: React95, Next.js
- **Inspiration Repositories**:
  - [henriquespecian/casamento-nextjs](https://github.com/henriquespecian/casamento-nextjs)
  - [InsafKhamzin/portfolio](https://github.com/InsafKhamzin/portfolio)
- **Base Template Forked From**: [React95 Next.js Template](https://github.com/React95/nextjs-template)

## Implementation Process
I forked the Next.js React95 repository from [React95/nextjs-template](https://github.com/React95/nextjs-template). The Next.js framework was chosen for its flexibility in adding additional pages in the future. Although React95 seems to lend itself more towards a modal-based layout, Next.js's page router simplifies potential future expansions.

## Conclusion
This project represents my attempt to blend nostalgia with modern web development practices. Utilizing React95's retro aesthetic and Next.js's flexibility, I aim to present my portfolio in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner.
